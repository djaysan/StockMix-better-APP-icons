# StockMix-better-APP-icons for the TRIMUI BRICK

Disclaimer: 
I made this pack for my personal use - I only designed the icons for the apps used in stockmix.
The other Icons and BG are not mine, I just renamed them and placed them in the correct folder for them to show up on my device.

- Added a new theme 'BLACK' based on the dark but more subtile and fits better with the Noire BG imo.

Instructions:
Simply drag & drop to merge all the folders.
To use ALT icons or BG images - drag them out of their folder to overwrite the exisitng ones

Note:
I couldn't change the icons for stock apps: fnkey, monnlight, mediaplayer, usb storage, sd formatter - i made the icons but i just don't know where to place them...

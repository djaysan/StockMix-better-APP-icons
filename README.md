# StockMix-better-APP-icons for the TRIMUI BRICK

Disclaimer: 
I made this pack for my personal use - I only designed the icons for the apps used in stockmix.
The other Icons and BG are not mine, I just renamed them and placed them in the correct folder for them to show up on my device.

- It also includes new icons for the extra emulators from Reddit user @RWGlix - posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/trimui/comments/1hqnrz2/stockmix_6_new_emulator_catagories/ (https://drive.google.com/file/d/10_MxbgHJ6Pb9TQUoUftVsPk_wt35ZNn6/view)
- Added a new theme 'BLACK' based on the dark but more subtile and fits better with the Noire BG imo.

Simply drag & drop to merge all the folders.

Note:
I couldn't change the icons for stock apps: fnkey, monnlight, mediaplayer, usb storage, sd formatter - i made the icons but i just don't know where to place them...
